Digital Health Product Hunt
===========================

Ruby-based "Product Hunt"-style site with a Sinatra server. This was my first project, completed ~3 weeks after I started coding. Much of the time was spent on learning the basics of CSS and playing with a few common CSS libraries, and the layout and responsiveness still leaves a TON to be desired.

### Languages Used

* Ruby (Sinatra)
* HTML/ CSS (Font-Awesome, Normalize.css, Grid.css)
